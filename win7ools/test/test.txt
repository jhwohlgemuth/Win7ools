SKILLS
======

Analysis / Problem-Solving
--------------------------
 * Completed 9 units of ***operations research*** courses while working toward a Mathematics masters which strengthened my ability to apply mathematics to real-world problems and achieve ***immediate*** process improvement.
 * Wrote thesis, ["Small World Network Properties of Facebook Group Networks"][thesis]. The research involved leveraging a python Facebook API to retrieve public data from Facebook, then performing statistical and network analysis on the data using assorted python data analysis/visualization modules such as NetworkX.py and Matplotlib, mathematical software such as MATLAB and Maple, and personal scripts. The delivery and defense of the thesis showcased the ability to defend a logical position, speak in public, present large amounts of data, and create documents using LaTeX. ***Thesis has been approved for publication in the scientific journal, *[Complex Systems][Complex Systems]*.***
 * Performed statistical analysis on large datasets and combined the results with network properties such as clustering coefficients and average shortest paths to obtain a more complete understanding of the data.

Engineering / General Management
--------------------------------
 * As a division officer on a submarine, supervised the daily operations of a nuclear reactor and engine room at sea and in port, maintaining electrical power to vital systems throughout the submarine.
 * Led teams through complex technical evolutions, during maintenance and casualty situations, maximizing efficiency while maintaining a safe environment.
 * Demonstrated a consistently high ***aptitude for learning*** in multiple learning institutions such as the Navy Nuclear Power School, the Navy's most difficult school(*graduated in the top half*).
 * As an undergraduate, worked as a lab assistant for the department chair investigating plasma phenomena. Constructed circuitry to detect and analyze ion acoustic waves that was later integrated into an upper level experimental physics laboratory course.
