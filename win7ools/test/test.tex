\subsection{Analysis / Problem-Solving}\label{analysis-problem-solving}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Completed 9 units of \textbf{\emph{operations research}} courses while
  working toward a Mathematics masters which strengthened my ability to
  apply mathematics to real-world problems and achieve
  \textbf{\emph{immediate}} process improvement.
\item
  Wrote thesis,
  \href{http://www.jasonwohlgemuth.com/doc/thesis.pdf}{``Small World
  Network Properties of Facebook Group Networks''}. The research
  involved leveraging a python Facebook API to retrieve public data from
  Facebook, then performing statistical and network analysis on the data
  using assorted python data analysis/visualization modules such as
  NetworkX.py and Matplotlib, mathematical software such as MATLAB and
  Maple, and personal scripts. The delivery and defense of the thesis
  showcased the ability to defend a logical position, speak in public,
  present large amounts of data, and create documents using LaTeX.
  \textbf{\emph{Thesis has been approved for publication in the
  scientific journal, }\href{https://www.complex-systems.com/}{Complex
  Systems}\emph{.}}
\item
  Performed statistical analysis on large datasets and combined the
  results with network properties such as clustering coefficients and
  average shortest paths to obtain a more complete understanding of the
  data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Engineering / General
Management}\label{engineering-general-management}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  As a division officer on a submarine, supervised the daily operations
  of a nuclear reactor and engine room at sea and in port, maintaining
  electrical power to vital systems throughout the submarine.
\item
  Led teams through complex technical evolutions, during maintenance and
  casualty situations, maximizing efficiency while maintaining a safe
  environment.
\item
  Demonstrated a consistently high \textbf{\emph{aptitude for learning}}
  in multiple learning institutions such as the Navy Nuclear Power
  School, the Navy's most difficult school(\emph{graduated in the top
  half}).
\item
  As an undergraduate, worked as a lab assistant for the department
  chair investigating plasma phenomena. Constructed circuitry to detect
  and analyze ion acoustic waves that was later integrated into an upper
  level experimental physics laboratory course.
\end{itemize}
